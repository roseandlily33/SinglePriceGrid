# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution

This is a solution to the [Single price grid component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
This is my solution to the single price grid component on front end mentor, it's a little different then the original colouring, in the stylesheet it didnt have more than one shade of cyan, so I decided to make one of the sections a lime green colour.

## My process
I started with doing the HTML, and dividing it into sections for the top, middle and bottom, The middle also goes to the right side and the bottom goes to the left, but on mobile it's stacked on top of eachother. I then went in and started the customizing with the border-radius, colours etc. There was on issue I came across which was quite difficult to fix for some reason and that was centering it perfectly in the middle of the page, so I made another outer div, around the container and used padding: 10%, and that fixed it.
